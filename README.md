# ESP32-CAM_MJPEG2SD-PanTiltServo
This is a fork of s60c's [ESP32-ESP32-CAM_MJPEG2SD](https://github.com/s60sc/ESP32-CAM_MJPEG2SD) transfered into a platform.io-Project, using Servo Library from [RoboticsBrno](https://github.com/RoboticsBrno/ServoESP32) to control a Pan-Tilt-Camera stand. The two servos are connected to GPIO 1 and GPIO 3, so Serial-Debug-Interface has been disabled in this version. 

### ToDos:
* add documentation and pictures for wirering camera stand.
* cleanup code
* test recording video while using servos
